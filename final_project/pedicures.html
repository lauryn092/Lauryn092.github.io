Your feet are soaked in warm water to soften the skin and relax your muscles.
Nails are trimmed, shaped, and gently filed. Cuticles are pushed back and cleaned up for a neat, healthy look.
A scrub or foot file is used to remove dry, dead skin—especially around heels and soles.
Feet and lower legs are massaged with a nourishing lotion or oil to hydrate the skin and boost circulation.

Begins with a warm soak to cleanse and soften the feet, followed by nail and cuticle grooming.
Acrylic is applied directly to the natural toenails or tips (if added length is desired), then shaped and smoothed to your preference.
Once hardened, nails are filed and buffed for a clean, even finish.
Choose a gel or regular polish, or go for a custom design.
Finished with lotion or oil to hydrate and refresh your feet.
